see Leyendo_v2_client for frontend

Production version: https://cocky-easley-edf596.netlify.app/

This is the frontend of Leyendo v2, a improved version of v1. Leyendo aims to provide readers with access to the best writing across the internet. Authenticated users are able to like and comment on pieces that they enjoy.

**A few notes on the v2:**

The frontend is built in React and uses functional components with hooks. Within React, I have also used react-router-dom and react-hook-form.

The Apollo-client is used in order to manage data with GraphQL. (I have discussed my use of GraphQL in more depth in Leyendo_v2_server.

I have primarily used Semantic for design.

**Plans for v3 frontend:**

V3 of Leyendo will provide a better user journey beginning from the home page.

Cleaner and cooler design.

There will also be a couple of new features, details of which I won't currently disclose!
